# Cluster Node API

I was using the Cluster API to model a PM2 process on local development Enviroment.
This was really interesting and cool to get started on.

Download the project and Install

```shell
	npm install
```

Then start the program and run a simple curl request on to test the API.

```shell
	npm start
```

I hope you have fun running or adding more functionality to this simple Nodejs Cluster.
